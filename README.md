## Why This Project?

This project was built for personal use, not as a tutorial exercise.

While working at a restaurant, I needed a simple way to:

Track shifts accurately

Calculate tips and total pay

Prepare reports I actually submit to my manager

Building SushiTime helped me practice real-world problem solving, data handling, and frontend development using modern tools.
